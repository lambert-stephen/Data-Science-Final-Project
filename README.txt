Note: Even though we split up the problems amongst each other, we all helped each other and reviewed the inputted solutions to verify their correctness.

Jasmine updated problems 1,2, and 5. Helped with the Linear Regression and scrapping by keeping track of what was needed and the resoucres for it. She also led the meetings and made herself as available as much as possible and contributed to questions about the program and contributed to the analysis of the project.

William was in charge of scraping the websites and merging the data together. He also did the write up for problem 1, 2, and 3. He also did all the Linear Regression and clustering code. He also made sure we were on top of doing are parts that each teammate given.

Stephen was doing problem 4 and exploring all of the data that we were given and coming up which variable is best to use for Linear Regression. Also, helped out with other problems when he had a chance too as well.
